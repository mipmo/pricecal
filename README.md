# pricecal
This is the Python implementation of the price comparison program I wrote on the TI-84 Plus CE-T.

#### What it does and how it works
The Price Calculator can compare the two prices of two products, regardless of their weight or amount.
It does this by comparing the Price Per Unit (PPU) of both products, which it can calculate from the entered price and amount.
This program can compare exactly two products for the time being. If I find enough spare time, I will try to extend this to any amount of products.
